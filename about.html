                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Hey there <strong>food lovers!</strong> We're the <em>Foodie</em> family, your friendly neighborhood food enthusiasts hailing from the picturesque city of Edinburgh,
                UK. We're just your regular folks with an extraordinary passion for food. But not just any food, mind you! We're all
                about delivering the freshest, healthiest, and most mouthwatering dishes right to your doorstep.</p>

                <p>Foodie is our own restaraunt but we can facilitate your order from other restaraunts too! Just use the search bar to enter your post code and choose to browse one of our loal partnered establishments or one of our foodie chains that specialise in Greek cuisine</p>
                
                <p>Our journey began with a shared love for Greek cuisine. Picture this: warm Mediterranean breezes, sun-kissed
                olive groves, and a table laden with delectable Greek delights. It was love at first bite, and we couldn't help but
                bring that love back home to our fellow foodies.<br> And yes, Gordon Ramsay came to our first restaurant opening!</p>
